# Computer-Component-Store-
A client server application, providing a service to clients to purchase Computer components from an online store. Server side developed in java using hibernate for database management, Spring Boot for creating the service and Maven to build the project, along with a multi-branch pipeline on Jenkins to incorporate the ability of continuous integration. Client side developed in JavaScript/TypeScript using AngularJS.

Over the course of developing this application, I invloved the use of OOP principles, Design patterns such as the Builder pattern & the Factory pattern and the use of Java 8 features such as streams and lambda expressions.
